      <i>Upon selecting the Warhammer, the paladin feels its weight and balance, and an ancient energy courses through them. The Warhammer, though heavy, feels like an extension of their own arm. The head of the hammer is engraved with runes that glow faintly, suggesting that this is no ordinary weapon but one imbued with magic from a time long past.</i>
